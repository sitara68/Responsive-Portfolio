        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/Bio-Photo.jpg" alt="Melanie C. Rose" class="myBioPic">
        <p>I was born in San Antonio, Texas on July 24, 1968, a year before the manned lunar landing. I have lived in the Houston, Texas area for over 20 years. I have one adult daughter and many firends. I have worked for a major electricity provider for the past 18 years and I am actively seeking a career in web development.</p>

        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy knitting and photography. I used to camp and hike quite a bit and I am actively seeking to restart those endeavors. I have practiced yoga since the age of 12. While I have not done as much as I would like, I do enjoy travel. I have toured mainland Greece. Visited the city of London and the city of Paris. I have camped in the Arizona desert and the Grand Canyon. I have enjoyed the Carribean beaches in Jamaica and Mexico. Overall, I would consider Paris my favorite place to visit.</p>
